        Project: Animals Page
      </h3>
      <p>
        Create your own animals page with three animals in three articles, each with text, an image, and its own styling. Use IDs to make each article distinct. Remember to bookmark the original location of your images.
      </p>
      <p>
        To save time, a template for the project has been placed in you server folder.</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of the project, we will each have something like <a href='example-animals'>Mr. H's example</a>.

        Homepage: Box Model
      </h3>
      <p>
        Today we learn about adding images and the properties of the box model. The box model represents everything on the webpage as a rectangle of content with a background-color behind it. Padding goes on the inside, between the edge and the content; margin goes on the outside, keeping the edge of the box away from other elements and the edge of the page; border sits on the edge of the box; and width / height determine the size of the box - but be careful not to squish your content!
      </p>
      <pre>
h1 {
  margin: 10px; /* Note the 'px' for pixels. */
  padding: 10px;
  border: 10px solid #000000;
  /* border: size style color */
}</pre>
