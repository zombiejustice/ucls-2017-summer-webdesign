        I. Setting up FTP
      </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href='http://codeanywhere.com'>CodeAnywhere.com</a> and click the button labelled 'Sign up for Free'.</li>
        <li>Fill in your e-mail address, choose a password, and try to prove you're human.</li>
        <li>If you've convinced them that you're human, you should see the page below. Click the link to the editor, the one that says, 'here'. <img src='ss1-3.png' /></li>
        <li>The connection wizard should be the next screen you see. You want to connect to your server using File Transfer Protocol, so click "FTP" in the left-hand column.</li>
        <li>For connection name, use your codename, all lowercase with no spaces.</li>
        <li>For hostname, type "trivium.phpwebhosting.com"</li>
        <li>For username, put in "slabweb" or "slabweb17", whichever you've been assigned.</li>
        <li>The password is <em>not</em> the password for CodeAnywhere or your e-mail. Use the class password written on the board.</li>
        <li>For 'Initial dir', put in "www/yourcodename", where 'yourcodename' is replaced with your actual codename.</li>
        <li>Doublecheck that it looks generally like the image below and then click 'Connect'. <img src='ss1-10.png' /></li>
      </ol>

        II. Put your page on the Web
      </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Right-click on the connection (it will be labelled with your codename). <img src='ss2-1.png' /></li>
        <li>Click on upload. Drag your files into the box that appears.</li>
        <li>Right-click on your firstpage.html and select 'Rename'. Rename the file to "index.html" .</li>
        <li>Go to your website ( eg. "slabweb17.phpwebhosting.com/yourcodename" ) and check that the files are in place. If you did not rename your firstpage to "index.html", you may see a page like the one below. Please fix this. <img src='ss2-4.png' /></li>
        <li>You can also use the <a href='/script-checker'>Project Checker</a> to verify that your page is in the right place.</li>
      </ol>
