      </h2>

        <li>Log into your email account to make sure you remember the password. Leave this tab open.</li>
        <li>If you can't access your e-mail, sign up for a new account. <a href='http://gmail.com'>Gmail</a> makes this easy.</li>

        <li>Go to <a href='http://codeanywhere.com'>CodeAnywhere.com</a> and click the button labelled 'Sign up for Free'.</li>
        <li>Fill in your e-mail address (again, the one you're logged into on the other tab), choose a password, and try to prove you're human.</li>

        <li>The connection wizard should be the next screen you see. You want to connect to your server using File Transfer Protocol, so click "FTP Server" in the left-hand column.<li>
        <li>For connection name, use your handle.</li>
        <li>For hostname, paste in the hostname you copied earlier on x10. It may be different than the one in the image below.</li>
        <li>For username, put in the eight-letter username x10 gave you earlier.</li>
        <li>The password is your password for x10, <em>not</em> the password for CodeAnywhere or your e-mail.</li>
        <li>For 'Initial dir', put in "public_html", just like that, all lowercase with the underscore.</li>
        <li>Doublecheck that it looks like the image below and then click 'Connect'. <img src='ss3-10.png' /></li>
